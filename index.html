								<p>Hi everyone! My name is Nguyen Thanh Thien</p>
								<p>Student number: s3817852</p>
								<p>I am 19 years ago</p>

								<p>To be honest, my first major is about health, not IT. But after studying at Pham Ngoc Thanh university for 3 months, I realized that it wasn't my career that I am looking for. Then my friends recommended that I should change school and study at RMIT. After looking at some majors at RMIT, I found that information technology could be a better major for me. And at the moment, I am studying a bachelor's of IT and I want to become a full-stack developer in the near future.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/fullsizeoutput_3e8.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>After taking a tour around the RMIT campus and I have seen that it could be a perfect place to actualize my dream. The first reason is that this place has many facilities as well as support services which are helpful for newbies like me. Another point is that I have met many friends who are friendly and funny and thanks for having them, I don't feel lonely.

</p>
								
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1045.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p> RMIT is an international school, so the first thing I expect to learn is having good English as well International diploma. Moreover, I can have an opportunity to apprentice  in big companies when I Am a senior. And finally, add some extra points in my CV thanks to joining some community activities.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Job</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/fullsizeoutput_3ee.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The first reason why I like to become a full-stack developer is that it has a higher salary than other developers such as web developers. Another point is that I don't have to worry about being unemployed since a full-stack developer can move to the front end or back end developer without being time-consuming or having a shortage of knowledge. Finally, I also have an opportunity to become a software architect because a full-stack developer has known a wide range of fields such as front end, back end or design which help full-stack developers get an overall view.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1046.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Technology in our lives is digitally updated therefore I suppose that the first element of a full-stack developer is delicate and diligent learning new things. Moreover, responsibility is an integral element of a full-stack developer because they have a lot of work to address from ideas to plans or from selecting customers' requirements to designing interfaces. Last but not least, a full-stack developer needs to have flexible knowledge from HTML, CSS or Javascript to back-end program languages or the ability to analyze data and solve the issue.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1048.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I suppose that I have a lot of work to do if I want to actualize my dream. Regarding non-technical skills, I will find and register in the IT club in RMIT in order to get new friends and do some events with club members, which is a good chance for me to practice teamwork or communication skills. On the other hand, about technical skills, there are plenty of resources on the internet or in RMIT's library which is helpful to me to self-study. However, one of these resources might be misleading and incredible, consequently, I will need time to select it. Therefore, I will ask my teachers or student academic services for advice if I have any trouble with my studying.</p>

								<p>According to an online Myers-Briggs test, I’m a defender which is quite a cute name. And I think that this test is nearly true about myself( 80% I guess) like defenders good analytical abilities or a conservative type. Interestingly, I can find some weaknesses in myself such as reluctant to change or too altruistic which are true but before that, I didn't notice. </p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic03.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I suppose that this test makes me feel more confident when working as a group. Simply because it makes me believe that I have some essential elements of the leader such as supportive or reliable and patient. But honestly, due to this result, I feel to be extolled to the skies. And if I don't good enough like the result mentioned, then I will be disappointed about myself.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1047.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>I think that I tend to be a connection between my team members according to Myers-Briggs test:” Defenders are the universal helpers, sharing their knowledge, experience, time and energy with anyone who needs it.” Besides, enthusiastic would be a key factor in my team. After setting a goal, I tend to put all effort to make it realistic.</p>

								<p>As a developer, I always want my customers to have a good quality game and have a great time when playing games but not being addicted.Therefore, I suppose that an offline mobile game would be a great idea. And the game's name is The angry den and it will available on both IOS or Android systems for free.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1051.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The mobile game has become a leisure activity in many years and people might not deny the benefit of playing games. Moreover, according to IndianExpress, ”the game has already crossed 200 million downloads and has at least 30 million active users. So, the popularity of games on mobile devices is steadily increasing and with that, the demand for excellent graphics as well.” which means the game industry can be a huge market in the next few years. Hence, a start-up with a mobile game could be a potential way for my career.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1052.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This angry hen probably will be a role-playing game. During the game, the players will role as hens and their eggs are threatened by wolves. Therefore, you have to go to the jungle, then try to find and defeat the wolf's den,  and regain your eggs. On your journey, you will come across a lot of villages such as pig’s village and monkey’s village, and you will have new friends who role as supporters. The game has five chapters which represent five villages. In each village, you will have small missions to gain golds and experiences. The similarity of five villages is that villagers all hate the Wolves because they have to pay tribute to them, if not do, the wolf will destroy the village. So, at the end of each chapter, you and your allies will fight with a wolf and each wolf will give you a clue to the wolf's den. Additionally, in each village, you will have a chance to buy or upgrade your weapons such as swords or shields. Interestingly, you will also be able to learn special skills which will increase your damage. The angry hen is an offline game, so players do not need to worry about being disrupted by advertising. Moreover, all the missions are based on an attractive plot so players do not have to do some extra missions such as daily login gifts. Instead of that, this game has some mini-games at the main interface in case players have completed the story.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1053.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>About tools, I might use the Unreal Engine which is the next version of the Unreal Development Kit in order to design my mobile game. Simply because it is suitable for junior developer like me due to the shortage of prior experiences. Moreover, it has many features with supporting me in making a mobile game as well as in PCs and Game consoles.Besides, Unreal Engine is used commonly by many game developers.</p>
								<p>Additionally, I found out that unity also can be a great tool to start my first game app. According to blog.eduonix.com,”One of the highly famed choices for creating games, Unity allows the user to create 2D and 3D games. It is a favorite of the developer community to create an abundant amount of AAA-class games.” Moreover, on Unity web pages, there are plenty of tutorials that can help me understand Unity’s applications insight.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1055.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Personally, I have to prepare myself a standard knowledge about some programming languages such as C++, Java, HTML5 or PHP. On the other hand, about non-technical skills, I am a junior developer, so it might take a lot of time to create and run my game. From that point, I will work with others in order to complete faster and gain more experience. More importantly, I need to work consistently with the design team because I need to make sure that my game content is not misleading or irrelevant to my original story. </p>
								<p>There are also many problems before I start this project. Firstly, at the moment, the main players prefer to play online games since it is more fun, especially when you play with your friends. Another point is that The angry hen is my first app, consequently, I need to purchase some money for advertising. And of course, I have to find investment from businesses or might be my parent.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/IMG_1050.JPG" alt="" /></span>
								<p>If this game is successful, I will make more version of The angry hen. And this time, it will be an online version, I might use Facebook or Instagram in order to help players make new friends. Additionally, I can gain an amount of money from this game and I can make more games to increase my income. In contrast, if the angry hen is not popular, I will lose a small amount of money but I will learn new things from my fail. For example, using programming languages more effectively, so my game has more features more attractive or learning to use marketing strategies to advertise my game better.</p>
